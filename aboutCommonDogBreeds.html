          The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for
          the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head,
          with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is
          a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens move with a smooth, powerful gait, and
          the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say, with a “merry action.”
          Goldens are outgoing, trustworthy, and eager-to-please family dogs, and
          relatively easy to train. They take a joyous and playful approach to life
          and maintain this puppyish behavior into adulthood. These energetic, powerful
          gundogs enjoy outdoor play. For a breed built to retrieve waterfowl for hours
          on end, swimming and fetching are natural pastimes.

          There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder,
          and those between 13 and 15 inches. Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and
          “big for their inches,” as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors
          as lemon, red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle’s fortune is in his adorable f
          ace, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by long, houndy ears set low on a
          broad head. A breed described as “merry” by its fanciers, Beagles are loving
          and lovable, happy, and companionable—all qualities that make them excellent
          family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has been the most popular
          hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic
          hounds who require plenty of playtime.

          The Pug’s motto is the Latin phrase “multum in parvo” (a lot in a little)—an
          apt description of this small but muscular breed. They come in three colors:
          silver or apricot-fawn with a black face mask, or all black. The large round
          head, the big, sparkling eyes, and the wrinkled brow give Pugs a range of human-like
          expressions—surprise, happiness, curiosity—that have delighted owners for centuries.
          Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city
          or country, with kids or old folks, as an only pet or in a pack. They enjoy
          their food, and care must be taken to keep them trim. They do best in moderate
          climates—not too hot, not too cold—but, with proper care, Pugs can be their
          adorable selves anywhere.

    <h1>Yorkshire Terrier</h1>

      <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-7">
        <p>
          The Yorkshire Terrier is a compact, toy-size terrier of no more than seven
          pounds whose crowning glory is a floor-length, silky coat of steel blue and a
          rich golden tan. Don’t let the Yorkie’s daintiness fool you. Tenacious, feisty,
          brave, and sometimes bossy, the Yorkie exhibits all the traits of a true terrier.
          Often named the most popular dog breed in various American cities, Yorkies pack
          lots of big-town attitude into a small but self-important package. They are
          favorites of urbanites the world over. Yorkies are long-lived and low-allergen
          (the coat is more like human hair than animal fur), and they make fine little
          watchdogs. This is a true “personality breed,” providing years of laughs, love,
          and close companionship.

        <p>
          Standing less than a foot high at the shoulder, Lhasas are small but hardy dogs
          of aristocratic bearing. They’re famous for a floor-length, flat-hanging coat,
          parted in the middle and draping each side of the body. A feathery tail curls
          over the back in the distinct manner of Tibetan breeds. The breed’s fans say
          the dark, oval-shaped eyes—peeping through lavish facial hair—are the windows
          of a Lhasa’s merry soul. The complete picture is elegant and serenely well balanced.

          The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches
          at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet
          black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are
          breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add
          to the Berner’s aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather,
          the Berner’s brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of
          Switzerland. Berners get along with the entire family and are particularly
          gentle with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky
          human. Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof
          dignity with strangers.

          Maltese are affectionate toy dogs weighing less than seven pounds, covered
          by a long, straight, silky coat. Beneath the all-white mantle is a compact body
          moving with a smooth and effortless gait. The overall picture depicts free-flowing
          elegance and balance. The irresistible Maltese face—with its big, dark eyes
          and black gumdrop nose—can conquer the most jaded sensibility. Despite their
          aristocratic bearing, Maltese are hardy and adaptable pets. They make alert
          watchdogs who are fearless in a charming toy-dog way, and they are game little
          athletes on the agility course. Maltese are low-shedding, long-lived, and happy
          to make new friends of all ages. Sometimes stubborn and willful, they respond
          well to rewards-based training.

          The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either
          brown or blue—and sometimes one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even
          mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their
          powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60
          pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the
          Alaskan Malamute. In fact, breeders and fanciers prefer the moniker Siberians
          over huskies, as the latter suggests a bigger, brawnier dog than what is the
          standard for the breed. As born pack dogs, Siberians enjoy family life and
          get on well with other dogs; their innate friendliness render them indifferent
          watchdogs. This breed is also energetic and can’t resist chasing small animals,
          so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Siberians
          are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.

        <p>
          Poodles come in three size varieties: Standards should be more than 15
          inches tall at the shoulder; Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys stand no
          more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the same build and proportions.
          At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental Clip.
          Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting Clip, in which the coat is shorn
          to follow the outline of the squarely built, smoothly muscled body. Forget
          those old stereotypes of Poodles as sissy dogs. Poodles are eager, athletic,
          and wickedly smart “real dogs” of remarkable versatility. With an abundance
          of steady character and intelligence, the Toy Poodle is a “person” and expects
          to be treated like one.
